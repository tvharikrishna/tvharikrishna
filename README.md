👋 Hi, I’m @tvharikrishna - Hari Krishna (HK)
🤖 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼, 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗮𝘀𝘁𝘀!

🌱 About Me
My journey with robotics began in my early years and has grown ever since. I invite you to explore my profile and join me on this fascinating voyage. From understanding the magic of a simple DC motor to sophisticated projects, my life has revolved around the wonders of robotics.

👀 Life at University at Buffalo (UB)
Currently advancing my studies with a Master of Science degree in robotics. I'm focused on:

SLAM
Sensor Fusion
Motion/Path Planning Algorithms
Diving deep into autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, I'm enhancing robot perception through cutting-edge computer vision techniques. My exploration extends to:

Deep Learning
Reinforcement Learning for Robotics Vision
Multi-agent Systems Animations using Unity-ML
On the hands-on side, I'm actively working with advanced robots, especially those leveraging the Jetson Nano GPU. Check out my projects! (Link to your projects tab)

💞️ My Background in Robotics
During my undergraduate years in Electronics and Communication, even without specialized robotics courses in my home country, my passion led me to:

Participate in over 30 robotics competitions, bagging top positions in many.
Become the president of The Robotics Club-SNIST.
Chair 'Roboveda,' a renowned national robotics symposium in India.
Train over 500 students in robotics, honing my teaching and public speaking abilities.
True success for me is when my teachings benefit others.

📫 Let's Connect!
