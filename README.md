  I'm Venkata Harikrishna Talapala, a Master’s student at the University at Buffalo, poised to graduate in December of this year with a specialization in robotics. I am actively seeking full-time roles starting in January 2024.
  My area of expertise encompasses machine perception and autonomous navigation, with a particular focus on technologies for autonomous vehicles, including perception systems and ADAS. In robotics, my work is focused on motion and path planning, mobile robotics, SLAM, sensor fusion, autonomous navigation, and map generation.
In the field of computer vision, I've tackled projects involving 3D reconstruction, depth information processing, and point cloud data, utilizing advanced deep learning models to refine perception techniques. Additionally, I have experience in training agents within game engine environments.
With a solid foundation in these areas, I am looking forward to full-time opportunities that will leverage my skills in the ever-evolving domains of robotics and autonomous systems.
