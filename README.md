    ✔ Single Stage Detectors  ✔  Double Stage Detectors  ✔  Vision Segementation  ✔  Optical Flow Estimation 

### What You'll Find in This GitHub Account:
Here, you'll come across a variety of repositories that include projects on the CARLA simulator, HK_Bot (my own robot), Robotics in ROS, Vision using AI and point clouds, and much more. Each project follows a proper naming convention where the first word indicates the category of the project and the next word, following an underscore, denotes the name of the project within that category. 

#### Categories and Their Respective Projects Naming Conventions that starts with:

- **CarlaSim_**  »»-----------►  Self-Driving Car Simulator projects on the CARLA Simulator.

- **ROSRobotics_** »»-----------► Projects on Robotics using the ROS Framework.

- **PointClouds_**  »»-----------►  Projects solely related to Point Clouds.

- **OpenCV_** »»-----------► Projects that are related to OpenCV.
    
- **VisionAI_** »»-----------► Projects that involve the use of Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision.

- **HKBOT_** »»-----------► Projects related to hands-on robotics.

Feel free to explore these repositories to get a glimpse of my work and interests in the field of robotics and AI. Each project is a testament to my dedication and enthusiasm in this domain.

_Happy coding!_ 🚀🤖
