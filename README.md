    ➣ I also have a keen interest in major computer vision techniques related to 3D reconstruction, depth estimation, stereo vision, and motion analysis. I utilize both OpenCV and other computer vision libraries for these tasks.

    ➣ I've designed a custom-built robot named HKBOT that operates on the Jetson Nano, where I implement real-time robotics projects. 

    ➣ As technology advances, I'm increasingly interested in developing computer vision solutions that leverage AI, utilizing tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

    ➣ Recently, I've also delved into animating RL agents in game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.
