### Welcome to my GitHub page, where I enthusiastically share projects and passions that span a diverse range of categories, not limited to the ones listed below:
#### 1️⃣ Robotics Projects ➔ ROS1 Framework 
#### 2️⃣ Carla Simulator Projects
#### 3️⃣ Computer Vision and Image Processing using OpenCV Projects
#### 4️⃣ 3D Reconstruction 
#### 5️⃣ Projects on HK_Bot ➔ Custom Made Robot by myself
#### 6️⃣ Machine Perception using Artificial Neural Networks 

### What You'll Find in This GitHub Account:
Here, you'll come across a variety of repositories that include projects on the **🚗 CARLA simulator**, **🦾HK_Bot** (my own robot), **🤖 Robotics in ROS**, **👀 Vision using AI** and **🌟 point clouds**, and much more. Each project follows a **⚠️ proper naming convention** where the **first word indicates the category of the project** and the next word, **following an underscore**, denotes the **name of the project** within that category. 

#### Categories and Their Respective Projects Naming Conventions that starts with:

- **CarlaSim_**     »»-----------► Projects on **Self-Driving Cars** using **Carla Simulator**.

- **ROSRobotics_**  »»-----------► Projects on **Robotics** using the **ROS** Framework.

- **PointClouds_**  »»-----------► Projects solely related to **Point Clouds and 3D Reconstruction**.

- **OpenCV_**       »»-----------► Projects that are related to **Computer Vision using OpenCV**.
    
- **VisionAI_**     »»-----------► Projects that involve the use of **Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision**.

- **HKBOT_**        »»-----------► Projects related to **hands-on robotics**.

Feel free to explore these repositories to get a glimpse of my work and interests in the field of robotics and AI. Each project is a testament to my dedication and enthusiasm in this domain.

_Happy coding!_ 🚀🤖
